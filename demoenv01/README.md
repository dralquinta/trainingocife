## File Structure and Contents



## backend.tf

This file contains the definition that allows OCI via the *AWS S3 Compatibility API* to interact with a bucket and remotely store the system's [tfstate](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/index.html) file. You may access the sample `backend.tf` file [here](backend.tf) and the following is the generic content of it:

```go
/* backend.tf
Author: DALQUINT - denny.alquinta@oracle.com
Purpose: Handles the storage of tfstate file in backend bucket
Copyright (c) 2017, 2021, Oracle and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved. */

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket   = "NAME_OF_THE_BUCKET"
    key      = "STRUCTURE/FOR/BUCKET/DIRECTORY/SYSTEM.tfstate"
    region   = "REGION"
    endpoint = "https://TENANCY_NAMESPACE_NAME.compat.objectstorage.REGION.oraclecloud.com"

    skip_region_validation      = true
    skip_credentials_validation = true
    skip_metadata_api_check     = true
    force_path_style            = true
  }
}
```

For this case, the file content is: 

| Property | Value                                                        | Comments                                                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| bucket   | tfstate_bucket                                               | This may be any bucket of your choice. When creating bucket, make sure versioning is enabled and that the bucket is private |
| key      | Environments/WLS/demoenv01.tfstate                           | This may be any structure. When concatenating a path, this will generate an inner structure inside bucket for ease of navigation. This files must never be erased unless there is an inconsistency between the code and the system status. This **name must be unique** per each system is created. This file is the corner stone of Terraform Infrastructure Status, so **must not be tampered.** To neglect this step, will compromise the infrastructure unicity and status, hence will potentially risk to corrupt the infrastructure. |
| region   | us-ashburn-1                                                 | This value will depend on which region the tenancy is currently subscribed and where the infrastructure is being created |
| endpoint | https://id82vjamxpqo.compat.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com | This is the concatenation of the tenancy namespace which can be found under Administration > Tenancy Details and the region where the tenancy is subscribed and infrastructure is being created. |



## main.tf

The following file is the main module orchestrator of the system. This will pull all the required backend modules stored on corresponding *OCIBE* projects and will pull them into `.terraform` local directory for usage. You may access the sample main.tf file [here](main.tf) and the following is the generic content of it:

This system is composed by 5 backend modules which are explained below: 

| Module                  | Comments                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| admin_compute           | Uses `suracompute` backend module to generate the required computes to host the AdminServer of Domain. This typically is 1 |
| managed_compute_cluster | Uses `suracompute` backend module to generate the required computes to host the managed servers of domain. This may vary from any value starting in 0. |
| nfs                     | Uses `surafss` backend module to generate the required NFS v3 Filesystems required by the domain. |
| loadbalancer            | Uses `suralbaas` backend module to generate the LBaaS Service which front ends the cluster |
| backendset              | Uses `suralbaasbes` backend module to generate the backend set associated to the computes previously created and then attaches this to the corresponding LBaaS. |

> **IMPORTANT:** The sample file is completely linked to https://github.com private repositories of denny.alquinta@oracle.com ownership. All files must be properly updated to poll code from internal repositories. This repos as are private will not grant public access to anyone and where use exclusively as a PoC. 

## output.tf

This file contains the outputs required by the Terraform/Ansible integration to work properly. The values on each output entry are the ones that are later executed by get_hosts_vars.sh script to produce the output json files inside json_stage directory that later on are parsed and processed by get_hosts_vars.py to write the ansible_hosts and playbook.yaml files. You may access to the content of it [here](output.tf). 



## provider.tf

This file contains the provider configuration, needed to connect to OCI. The values associated in this project are hardcoded to user denny.alquinta@oracle.com and should be properly updated to a service user. 



## system.tfvars

Along with [main.tf](main.tf) this is the second main pivotal file for system creation. This file contains the exact value of each variable referenced in [main.tf](main.tf). You may access the content of it [here](system.tfvars). The following is an explanation of each value:

**Variables for module: General Domain configuration

| Property         | Value                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| wls_domain_name  | Name that gets passed to ansible to configure the domain. This value represents the domain name across the entire domain configuration. This can be any string value |
| wls_cluster_name | Name that gets passed to ansible as WLS Cluster Name. Each domain only supports a single cluster. This can be any string value |
| ms_per_machine   | Number that represents the amount of managed servers that will be created per each compute that belongs to the cluster. If this value is set to 2, it means that each compute that composes the cluster will host 2 managed servers. This value must be calculated in function of the amount of memory available for the compute shape chosen. Consider that each managed server currently is configured with 4GB of Heapsize, applying best practices on Garbage Collection Management |



**Variables for module: admin_compute** 

| Property                                      | Value                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| admin_ssh_public_key                          | This is the full path of the SSH Public Key associated to the hosts. This file was created in API Key Management and AWS S3 Compatibility API Integration section in the following [README.md](../README.md) file. Refer to it for details on it's location |
| admin_ssh_private_key                         | This is the full path of the SSH Private Key associated to the hosts. This file was created in API Key Management and AWS S3 Compatibility API Integration section in the following [README.md](../README.md) file. Refer to it for details on it's location |
| admin_ssh_public_is_path                      | Determines if the SSH Public Key is stored on a file or in a variable. This value should **always** be **set** to **true** |
| admin_ssh_private_is_path                     | Determines if the SSH Private Key is stored on a file or in a variable. This value should **always** be **set** to **true** |
| admin_compute_availability_domain_list        | A collection list of Availability Domain Names, where the computes will be stored at. If tenancy region only contains a single Availability Domain, this collection list should include a single value. Pairing in Fault Domains is automatically done by the provider |
| admin_fault_domain_name                       | Value that contains an overload value in case you want to assign the AdminServer Compute to a specific Fault Domain. By default **should be left** **blank**. |
| admin_bkp_policy_boot_volume                  | Backup policy associated to the Admin Server compute boot volume. This may be bronze, silver or gold or any custom policy value associated to the compute. |
| admin_linux_compute_instance_compartment_name | Name of the compartment where Admin Compute artifact should be created |
| admin_linux_compute_network_compartment_name  | Name of the compartment where the Network definition for Admin Compute artifact is located at |
| admin_vcn_display_name                        | Name of the VCN where the Admin Compute artifact should be created |
| admin_num_instances                           | Amount of compute instances related to the Admin Server. This value should **always** be **set** to **1** |
| admin_compute_display_name_base               | Base name from where the Admin Server name will start to iterate. Expected behavior is BASENAMEXX where XX varies from 01 to n |
| admin_instance_image_ocid                     | OCID related to the golden image prebaked with WLS installation with corresponding patches. Current Image holds an [OFA](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/12.2/ssdbi/optimal-flexible-architecture-file-path-examples.html#GUID-BB3EE4F7-50F4-4A2D-8A0D-96B7CC44029B) installation with latest PSU available (WLS PSU 201001) |
| admin_instance_shape                          | Shape selected for Admin Server Compute. For details on shapes refer to the following [link](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Compute/References/computeshapes.htm). |
| admin_is_compute_private                      | Flag that determines if the compute should be created in a public or private subnet. If value is set to true, this will be created in whatever subnet is selected as private_network_subnet_name in [commons.tfvars](../commons.tfvars) file.
